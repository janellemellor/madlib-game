<p>When I go to the arcade with my <span id= "noun one"></span> there are lots of games to play. I spend
lots of time there with my friends. In the game X-Men
you can be different <span id= "noun two"></span>. The point of the game is to <span id= "verb one"></span> every robot. You also need to save people. Then you can
go to the next level.</p>

<p> In the game Star Wars you are Luke Skywalker
and you try to destroy every <span id= "noun three"></span>. In a car racing/motorcycle racing game you need to beat every computerized vehicle that you are
<span id= "verb two"></span> against.</p>

<p>There are a whole lot of other cool games. When
you play some games you win <span id= "noun four"></span> for certain scores. Once you're done you can
cash in your tickets to get a big <span id= "noun five"></span>. You can save your <span id= "noun six"></span> for
another time. When I went to this arcade I didn't
believe how much fun it would be. So far I have had a
lot of fun every time I've been to this great arcade!</p>
